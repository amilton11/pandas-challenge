# pandas-challenge

Here are my three observations based on the data:

1. Males account for 83%+ of the user base
2. Ages 20-23 make up more than 50% of the user base
3. Final Critic and Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm are the "hero" games here as they both ranki as #1 and #2 within the top 5 most popular items by purchase count and purchase value
